A beautiful, AI-assisted blogging platform where you can write, create images, and connect — built to feel like the early internet, with modern tech like Django, HTMX, and FrankenUI.

## 🚀 What I Built

- **Full Stack Web Application** using:
  - Python, Django
  - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  - FrankenUI for responsive design
- **AI Integration**
  - Llama 3.1 for automated text generation
  - Flux for on-demand AI image creation
- **Content Editing**
  - Quill WYSIWYG editor for seamless editing
  - HTMX for dynamic, server-side updates without page reloads
- **Search**
  - Used `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings + cosine similarity for ranked vector search (Funationality was removed)
- **Smooth User Experience**
  - No full page reloads, real-time AI assistance, and intuitive design

## 📖 The Story Behind It

> I started building this site because I wanted a personal website that looked **clean** and allowed me to experiment with **HTMX**.  
>  
> I had never built something with truly good UI/UX, so this was my chance. As I worked, I realized this could be useful for more than just myself — so I kept building.  
>  
> I began around **September 2024**, and it took much longer than I expected because I kept adding “just one more feature.” Eventually, I decided it was time to launch.  
>  
> I wanted AI to be part of the experience, but not to replace human creativity. AI can help express thoughts we struggle to put into words, but I don’t want the site to be filled with meaningless “AI slop.”  
>  
> The interface is cleaner than traditional tools like Microsoft Word, offers easier search and organization, and allows publishing with a click.  
>  
> My goal is to capture the **spirit of the early internet** — when people connected, learned from each other, and exchanged real ideas.
